This is portfolio project presents a comprehensive sales analysis conducted for TechMart Electronics, a large electronics retailer facing profitability challenges due to high product return rates and strategic inefficiencies. Using SQL for EDA and analysis, as well as Power BI for interactive visualisation, this project aims to identify the root causes of the high Return Rate (24.80%) and evaluate the effectiveness of promotions and regional performance. The main objective of this project is to transform raw data into actionable strategic recommendations to help management (Ms. Anita) mitigate profit leakage and drive efficient growth.

- **Suboptimal Promotion:** SAVE10 has a relatively small contribution to revenue.

## Recommendation
**Mitigation of High Product Return Rates (Critical Product)** 

* **Prioritize Product & Logistics Quality Audit:** Immediately conduct a thorough audit of Chair, Laptop and Highly Return Rate  products. Investigate potential problems in:

   * Product Quality: Manufacturing defects, damage during shipping.
   *  Product Description: Discrepancies between the description on the website/advertisement and the actual product received.
   * Packaging & Shipping: Is the packaging strong enough to protect the product during transit? Are there any issues with specific carriers?

##
**Optimizing Promotion Strategy**

- **Promotion ROI Evaluation:** Conduct a more in-depth Return on Investment (ROI) analysis for each promotion. Compare the Total Revenue generated versus the Return Rate generated and the promotion costs.
- **SAVE10 Promotion Test:** Review the strategy behind the SAVE10 promotion. Is there a way to increase its appeal or target audience?
- **Maximize Successful Promotions:** Consider extending the scope or duration of the FREESHIP and WINTER15 promotions on products with low return rates to maximize revenue potential.

##
**How to Improved Regional Performance & Sales Channels**

- **Targeted Regional Strategy:** The marketing team should develop more specific and tailored campaigns for the South and East regions. Conduct market research to understand customer preferences or distribution challenges in these regions.
- **Store Performance Analysis:** Investigate the factors causing Store B's poor performance. This could involve staff training, local promotions, or inventory adjustments. Learn best practices from Store C and apply them to Store B.
